# Nick's Boilerplate

If I have to create a new website, I start with this.

## Configure and start meteor

Meteor is in the `platform` folder.

1. Rename `settings.example.json` to `settings.json` and adapt.

2. Adapt the `lib/constants.coffee` file.

3. Start meteor

    meteor --settings config/local.settings.json

## TODOS

* iron router -> flow router
* handlebars+viewmodel+blaze+jade -> react
* less -> sass
* SQL
* internationalization
